## Final Project - Numerical Tests

The aim is to understand if sub-optimal discriminator in GANs define a meaning-ful distance between two distributions.
We generated two sets of Gaussian distributions. The first set consists of one fixed distribution $P$.
The second set consists of a collection of distribution $\{Q_i\}_{i=1}^N$ approaching $P$ in some sense.
